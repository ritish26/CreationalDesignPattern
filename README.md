  The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle emphasizes simplicity in design and implementation.
  The idea is to avoid unnecessary complexity, making systems easier to understand, maintain, and use.

**DRY:**

  Donot Repeat yourself. Extracting common functionality into a method to avoid repeating the same code.
