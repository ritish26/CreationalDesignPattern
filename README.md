  The idea is to avoid unnecessary complexity, making systems easier to understand, maintain, and use.

  The new version is more simpler and easy to understand as we are not using conditional operatos.


**DRY:**

  Donot Repeat yourself. Extracting common functionality into a method to avoid repeating the same code.
